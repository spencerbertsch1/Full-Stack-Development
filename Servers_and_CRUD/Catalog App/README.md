# Winter Sports Catalog

Keep track of all your winter spots needs with this catalog! From mountain sports to fun on the ice, this catalog contains items associated with 
four main snowsport catelgoris. 

This site uses CRUD functionality with a SQLite database backend - users can add new items, edit items, view items, and remove items from the catalog.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Flask
- httplib2
- SQL Alchemy

## JSON API Endpoints

This app also serves two API endpoints which will return either the categories in the database, or each of the items currently residing in each category. 

- Categories in the database: http://localhost:5000/catalog/JSON
- Items in the skiing category: http://localhost:5000/catalog/1/JSON

*Note: Changing the category ID in the URL will return data for different categories.*
